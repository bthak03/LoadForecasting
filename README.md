## Challenge and solution ![image]
Energy load forecasting is one of the most challenging field. 
Traditionally, load forecasting relied upon weather as one of the important feature. Models like multiple linear regression were very helpful for predicting the energy load. 
However, with help of new machine learning algorithms there is a huge scope of improving forecasting.
With new forecasting techniques, and with the help of additional data overall load forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved.

Energy demand usually peaks up during the summer months.
Weather characteristics like temperature, humidity, and wind can be used as a factor to understand forecast load in a better manner.

Cooling degree days (CDD)are the temperature beyond which humans usually starts feeling uncomfortable.
Cooling degree days have a significant impact on energy consumption.
